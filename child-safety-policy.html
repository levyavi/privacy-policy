      <p class="last-updated">Last updated: <span id="date"></span></p>

      <p>
        This Child Safety Standards Policy describes our commitment to
        protecting children's safety online and our compliance with Google's
        Child Safety Standards Policy. This policy applies to our mobile
        application ("App") and supplements our Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <div class="important">
        <p>
          <strong>Zero Tolerance Policy:</strong> We have a zero-tolerance
          policy for child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE). Any content or
          behavior involving CSAE will result in immediate removal and reporting
          to appropriate authorities.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>1. Our Commitment to Child Safety</h2>
      <p>
        We are committed to providing a safe environment for all users,
        especially children. We comply with Google's Child Safety Standards
        Policy and all applicable laws and regulations regarding child
        protection, including but not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>

        <li>Google Play Child Safety Standards</li>
        <li>AdMob Child Safety Policies</li>
        <li>Applicable local and international child protection laws</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Age-Appropriate Content</h2>
      <p>
        Our App does not contain content that is inappropriate for children,
        including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sexually explicit material</li>
        <li>Graphic violence</li>
        <li>Profane language or hate speech</li>
        <li>Content that promotes harmful or illegal activities</li>
        <li>Content that exploits or endangers children</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We regularly review our App content to ensure it remains appropriate for
        all users, including children.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Data Collection from Children</h2>
      <p>
        Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not
        knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without
        verifiable parental consent in accordance with COPPA requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we discover that we have collected information from a child under 13:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We will delete that information promptly</li>
        <li>
          We will notify parents or guardians if we have their contact
          information
        </li>
        <li>We will take steps to prevent future collection from that child</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. COPPA Compliance</h2>
      <p>
        We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). In
        accordance with COPPA, we do not:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without
          verifiable parental consent
        </li>
        <li>
          Share personal information collected from children with third parties
          except as necessary to provide our services (and only with appropriate
          safeguards)
        </li>
        <li>
          Use personal information collected from children for behavioral
          advertising without parental consent
        </li>
        <li>
          Condition a child's participation in an activity on the child
          disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Age Verification</h2>
      <p>
        If our App contains content or features that may not be suitable for
        minors, we implement age verification mechanisms to prevent access by
        users under 18. This may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Requiring users to confirm their age before accessing certain features
        </li>
        <li>Implementing age gates for content that requires maturity</li>
        <li>Using age-appropriate content filters</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Parental Controls and Supervision</h2>
      <p>
        We encourage parents and guardians to actively supervise their
        children's online activities. We recommend:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Using device-level parental controls to monitor and restrict your
          child's access to apps and content
        </li>
        <li>Reviewing your child's app usage regularly</li>
        <li>Discussing online safety with your children</li>
        <li>
          Contacting us immediately if you have concerns about your child's use
          of our App
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Advertising and Child Safety</h2>
      <p>
        If our App displays advertisements through Google AdMob or other
        advertising networks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We ensure that ads served to children comply with COPPA requirements
        </li>
        <li>
          We configure our ad requests appropriately if our App is directed to
          children (tagging for child-directed treatment)
        </li>
        <li>
          We use only approved ad SDKs that are compliant with child safety
          standards
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not serve behavioral advertising to children without parental
          consent
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Reporting Concerns</h2>
