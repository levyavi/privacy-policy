This Child Safety Standards Policy describes our commitment to protecting children's safety online and our compliance with Google's Child Safety Standards Policy. This policy applies to our mobile application ("App") and supplements our Privacy Policy.

## Zero Tolerance Policy

**We have a zero-tolerance policy for child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE).** Any content or behavior involving CSAE will result in immediate removal and reporting to appropriate authorities.

Our App does not contain content that is inappropriate for children, including:

- Sexually explicit material

- Content that exploits or endangers children

We regularly review our App content to ensure it remains appropriate for all users, including children.

## 3. Data Collection from Children

Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without verifiable parental consent in accordance with COPPA requirements.

If we discover that we have collected information from a child under 13:

- We will delete that information promptly
- We will notify parents or guardians if we have their contact information

## 4. COPPA Compliance

We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). In accordance with COPPA, we do not:

- Knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without verifiable parental consent
- Share personal information collected from children with third parties except as necessary to provide our services (and only with appropriate safeguards)
- Use personal information collected from children for behavioral advertising without parental consent
- Condition a child's participation in an activity on the child disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary

## 5. Age Verification

If our App contains content or features that may not be suitable for minors, we implement age verification mechanisms to prevent access by users under 18. This may include:

- Requiring users to confirm their age before accessing certain features
- Implementing age gates for content that requires maturity
- Using age-appropriate content filters

## 6. Parental Controls and Supervision

We encourage parents and guardians to actively supervise their children's online activities. We recommend:

- Using device-level parental controls to monitor and restrict your child's access to apps and content
- Reviewing your child's app usage regularly
- Discussing online safety with your children
- Contacting us immediately if you have concerns about your child's use of our App

## 7. Advertising and Child Safety

If our App displays advertisements through Google AdMob or other advertising networks:

- We ensure that ads served to children comply with COPPA requirements

- We use only approved ad SDKs that are compliant with child safety standards
- We do not serve behavioral advertising to children without parental consent
